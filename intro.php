            <p>Please make sure, that you read all instructions carefully and that you spend appropriate time making
                your choices. This study takes roughly 20 minutes of your undivided attention. To be able to grant you
                the reward for participating at this study, we ask you to provide a DOT address (more information
                later).</p>

            <p>Generally, choices depend on your preferences and are neither right or wrong.</p>

            <p>Note that we keep the right to expel users from a reward at our discretion in the case that we see users
                exploiting the study (e.g., by not making choices carefully). Please do not share the participation code
                with anybody, because that would deprive you of the opportunity to earn the reward.</p>

            <p>During this study, we collect Personal Data in the form of e-mail and Polkadot addresses from
                participants.
                The sole purpose of this is to distribute further information on the study and to pay out participation
                rewards in DOT. After the data collection phase, that information is deleted and we only keep anonymized
                choices and responses from the users in this study. This data will be used for scientific purposes
                (e.g.,
                blog-posts, peer-reviewed papers and conferences). We do not make any effort to link individual answers
                to
                personal data.</p>
